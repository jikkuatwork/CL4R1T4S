Complete Analysis of All Coding Agent Prompts
3:16 PM, 29 May 2025

Successfully analyzed prompts from 16 different AI coding agents/assistants (excluding Anthropic). Completed comprehensive review of all prompt architectures, tool systems, and operational patterns. Ready to synthesize insights into comprehensive report.

- [x] Analyzed BOLT (WebContainer-based development)
- [x] Analyzed CURSOR (IDE-integrated assistant)
- [x] Analyzed DEVIN (Autonomous software engineer)
- [x] Analyzed GOOGLE GEMINI (Multi-modal with immersive docs)
- [x] Analyzed HUME (Voice-focused empathic AI)
- [x] Analyzed LOVABLE (Web app creator with live preview)
- [x] Analyzed MANUS (Task-oriented with Linux sandbox)
- [x] Analyzed MISTRAL LeChat (General assistant with browsing)
- [x] Analyzed MULTION (Browser automation specialist)
- [x] Analyzed OPENAI ChatGPT (Multi-tool assistant)
- [x] Analyzed PERPLEXITY (Deep research specialist)
- [x] Analyzed REPLIT (Cloud IDE assistant)
- [x] Analyzed SAMEDEV (Cloud IDE similar to Bolt)
- [x] Analyzed VERCEL V0 (UI/component generator)
- [x] Analyzed WINDSURF (Agentic with memory system)
- [x] Analyzed XAI Grok (General with X integration)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Context: Completed analysis of all 16 coding agent prompts. Identified key patterns in tool systems, operational paradigms, and specialized capabilities.
- [ ] Permission: Request permission to create comprehensive insights.md document.

Strategy Update - Skip Anthropic, Build Comprehensive Insights
3:11 PM, 29 May 2025

Updated strategy based on user feedback. Will skip ANTHROPIC folder and analyze all remaining services. Decision made to analyze all services first, then create a comprehensive insights.md file to identify patterns and commonalities across different coding agents.

- [x] Updated analysis strategy (skip Anthropic)
- [x] Decided to analyze all services before creating insights
- [x] Target output: /insights.md with comprehensive analysis

## Next Steps

- [ ] Context: Will analyze prompts from all services except Anthropic to build comprehensive insights about coding agent architectures and patterns.
- [ ] Permission: Request permission to proceed with systematic analysis of all remaining services.
- [ ] Analyze BOLT prompts
- [ ] Analyze CURSOR prompts
- [ ] Create comprehensive /insights.md after full analysis

Project Initialization - Repository Overview
3:08 PM, 29 May 2025

Successfully created log.md and conducted initial repository overview. The repository contains prompts from 17 different coding agents/assistants including Anthropic Claude, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Cursor, Devin, Replit, and others. Total of 38 prompt files to analyze.

- [x] Created log.md file
- [x] Conducted repository tree analysis
- [x] Identified 17 different AI coding agent categories
- [x] Counted 38 total prompt files to analyze

## Next Steps

- [ ] Context: I've been tasked to analyze prompts from various top coding agents in this repository and create a comprehensive blog post with key insights. I've identified 17 different AI agents with 38 prompt files total.
- [ ] Permission: Request permission to proceed with analyzing the first set of prompts (starting with ANTHROPIC folder).
- [ ] Begin systematic analysis of prompt files starting with ANTHROPIC/Claude_4.txt
